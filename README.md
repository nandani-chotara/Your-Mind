# Your-Mind
Close friends play a vital role in the lives of those struggling with mental health issues. Often times, people underestimate how stressful it is to help someone in the heat of the moment. In order to provide convenient guidance, we wanted to create a mobile app that is accessible to immediate step-by-step mental health "first-aid" from breathing to grounding exercises.

By voice command, Your Mind will pull up immediate exercises for the specified mental health issue (e.g. panic attacks). Your Mind will then walk you through steps for your friend in need for you to support them in their time of struggle. With an account, occurrences and be tracked. If the data shows it is necessary, Your Mind will recommend the appropriate consultation institutions near you.
